Welcome to the **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search .NET** repository! This project provides an AI-powered movie discovery API that understands natural language queries. It leverages vector embeddings and semantic search to enhance the movie recommendation experience.

## üöÄ Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understand user queries in plain language.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Utilize advanced embeddings for accurate results.
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant movies based on meaning, not just keywords.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Get personalized movie suggestions.
- **Integration with MongoDB Atlas**: Store and manage your data efficiently.

## üì¶ Getting Started

To start using the API, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elias160barrull/mongodb-atlas-vector-search-dotnet.git
   cd mongodb-atlas-vector-search-dotnet
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have .NET 10 installed. You can install the necessary packages by running:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB Atlas**:
   Set up your MongoDB Atlas cluster and get your connection string. Update your application settings to include this connection string.

4. **Run the API**:
   Start the application with:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access the API**:
   You can access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **.NET 10**: The framework for building the API.
- **MongoDB**: The database for storing movie data.
- **Ollama**: A library for natural language processing.
- **AI Embeddings**: Techniques for transforming text into vectors.
- **Vector Database**: For storing and retrieving vector data efficiently.

## üìö How It Works

### Natural Language Processing

The API uses NLP to parse user queries. It understands context and intent, making it easier for users to find movies they want to watch. 

### Vector Embeddings

By converting movie descriptions and user queries into vector representations, the API can compare their meanings. This allows for more relevant search results.

### Semantic Search

The semantic search capability enables the API to return results based on the meaning of the query rather than exact matches. This improves user satisfaction and engagement.

### Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine analyzes user behavior and preferences. It suggests movies that users are likely to enjoy based on their past interactions.

## üé® API Endpoints

### Search Movies

- **Endpoint**: `/api/movies/search`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "query": "A thrilling adventure"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "title": "Adventure in the Jungle",
      "description": "A thrilling tale of survival."
    }
  ]
  ```

### Get Recommendations

- **Endpoint**: `/api/movies/recommendations`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `userId`: The ID of the user for personalized recommendations.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "title": "Mystery of the Lost Treasure",
      "description": "An engaging mystery movie."
    }
  ]
  ```

## üîç Example Usage

### Search for Movies

You can send a POST request to the search endpoint with a natural language query. For example, to search for a movie with a thrilling adventure theme:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/movies/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "A thrilling adventure"}'
```

### Get Movie Recommendations

To get recommendations for a specific user, send a GET request:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/movies/recommendations?userId=123"
```

## üìà Performance

The API is designed to handle multiple requests efficiently. By utilizing vector databases and optimized queries, it ensures quick response times even under heavy load.

## üîí Security

Security is a priority in this project. Ensure you implement proper authentication and authorization for your API endpoints. Consider using JWT tokens for user sessions.
